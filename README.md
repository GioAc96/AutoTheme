# AutoTheme
Simple Ubuntu script that automatically changes both the Unity theme and Gedit color scheme, based on the current system time.
It's purpose is to change the look of Ubuntu to be darker during night ours, in order to make the screen brightness less disturbing.
Add a reference to this script in your Home/.bashrc file to access the goBright and goDark functions from the terminal.

By default, the scripts changes your system theme to either Arc or Arc-dark, which are two beautiful themes you can find at https://github.com/horst3180/arc-theme. If you wish to use other themes, you just have to change the content of the two variables (DARK, BRIGHT) declared in the first lines of the scripts.

I personally recommend to set this script to run at startup in order to make it automatically change your theme when you log in.
If you have any suggestion/feedback feel free to contact me at gioac96@gmail.com
