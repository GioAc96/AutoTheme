# AutoTheme

Simple Ubuntu script that automatically changes both the Unity theme and Gedit color scheme.
Add a reference to this scrip in your Home/.bashrc file to access the goBright and goDark functions from the terminal.
If you have any suggestion/feedback feel free to contact me at gioac96@gmail.com
